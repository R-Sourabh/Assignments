Objects:

    Key Types:
        In objects, keys are always strings or symbols. If you use any other data type as a key, it will be implicitly converted to a string.

    Key Order:
        The order of keys in an object is not guaranteed. While modern JavaScript engines maintain the order in most cases, it's not something you should rely on for all scenarios.

    Usage:
        Objects are commonly used for representing structured data and can be used as dictionaries or associative arrays.

Maps:

    Key Types:
        In maps, keys can be of any data type, including objects, functions, and primitive types. This makes maps more versatile when it comes to using different types of keys.

    Key Order:
        The order of keys in a map is guaranteed to be the order in which they were inserted. This makes maps useful in scenarios where key order matters.

    Usage:

        Maps are particularly useful when the keys are not known until runtime or when you need to maintain the order of key-value pairs.
