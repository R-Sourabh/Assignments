Regular Function:
function regularFunction(param) {
  return param + 1;
}

Regular functions in JavaScript are created using the function keyword. They have their own this value and are especially useful in certain scenarios where this binding is crucial, such as within constructors or methods.

Arrow Function:

const arrowFunction = (param) => param + 1;
Arrow functions are a more concise way to write functions in JavaScript. They are created using the arrow (=>) syntax. Arrow functions do not have their own this value; instead, they inherit this from the enclosing scope. This makes them particularly handy for functions where maintaining the this context is not a concern.
